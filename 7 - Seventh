//Exercise 7 - Area of a Rectangular Room. (Program that calculates the area of a room. Prompts the user for the length and width of the room in feet. Then displays the area in both square feet and square meters.)

    Scanner start_scan = new Scanner(System.in);  //Creation of a scanner object to allow for user input.

    System.out.println("What is the length of the room in feet? ");

    System.out.println("What is the width of the room in feet? ");
    String width = start_scan.nextLine();  //Reads room width in feet.
