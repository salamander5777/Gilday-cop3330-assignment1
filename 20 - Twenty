//Exercise 20 - Multistate Sales Tax Calculator. (Program that prompts for the order amount and the state. If the state is “WI,” then the order must be charged 5% tax, with an extra .5% for Eau Claire county residents and .4% for Dunn county residents. Then displays the state, county, tax, and total for Wisconsin/Illinois residents, or it will display just the state, county, and total for non-residents.)
