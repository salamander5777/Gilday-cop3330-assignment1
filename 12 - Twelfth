//Exercise 12 - Computing Simple Interest. (Program that computes simple interest. Prompts for the principal amount, the rate as a percentage, and the time, and displays the amount accrued)
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner start_scan = new Scanner(System.in);  //Creation of a scanner object to allow for user input.

    System.out.print("Enter the principal: ");
    String input_p = start_scan.next();  //Reads in the principle amount.
    System.out.print("Enter the rate of interest: ");

    System.out.print("Enter the number of years: ");

    //Below is the block of code used to convert input strings into doubles and does the math.
    double p = Double.parseDouble(input_p);
    double r = Double.parseDouble(input_roi);
    double rt = Double.parseDouble(input_roi)/100.00;
