//Exercise 13 - Determining Compound Interest. (Program that computes the value of an investment compounded over time. Then asks for starting amount, the number of years to invest, the interest rate, and the number of periods per year to compound.)

    Scanner start_scan = new Scanner(System.in);  //Creation of a scanner object to allow for user input.

    System.out.print("What is the principal amount: ");

    double a = Math.round(acrrued_trailing*100.00)/100.00; //Basic math to get 2 decimal places.
